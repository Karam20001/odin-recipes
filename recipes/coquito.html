        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Coquito is a creamy, tropical, Puerto Rican holiday drink with tons of coconut flavor.
             It's made with both evaporated and condensed milk, cream of coconut, spices, rum, and — in this version — egg yolks. 
             It is always requested at my holiday gatherings. Sometimes I hide it in the fridge to keep for myself! 
             Serve in glass cups and sprinkle with more cinnamon if desired. Feliz Navidad!</p>
