        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Coquito is a creamy, tropical, Puerto Rican holiday drink with tons of coconut flavor.
                It's made with both evaporated and condensed milk, cream of coconut, spices, rum, and — in this version — egg yolks. 
                It is always requested at my holiday gatherings. Sometimes I hide it in the fridge to keep for myself! 
                Serve in glass cups and sprinkle with more cinnamon if desired. Feliz Navidad!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Evaporated milk:</strong> This coquito recipe starts with a can of evaporated milk.</li>
                <li><strong>Egg:</strong> beaten egg yolks contribute to the rich, thick, and creamy texture.</li>
                <li><strong>Cream of coconut:</strong> Canned cream of coconut lends richness and gives the coquito its signature coconut flavor.</li>
                <li><strong>Sweetened condensed milk:</strong> Sweetened condensed milk makes everything more delicious, including this coquito recipe!</li>
                <li><strong>White rum:</strong> The best rum for coquito is white Puerto Rican rum, such as Bacardi. In a pinch, any pleasant-tasting white rum will do.</li>
                <li><strong>Water:</strong> Water thins the thick and creamy mixture, making it super pourable.</li>
                <li><strong>Vanilla:</strong> A teaspoon of vanilla extract takes the flavor up a notch.</li>
                <li><strong>Spices:</strong> Cinnamon and cloves add warmth and coziness.</li>
             </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
             <ol>
                <li>Gather all ingredients</li>
                <li>Combine evaporated milk and egg yolks in the top of a double boiler over simmering water.
                     Cook over the simmering water, stirring constantly, until mixture is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon,
                      and reaches a temperature of 160 degrees F (71 degrees C). </li>
                <li>Transfer mixture to a blender. 
                    Add cream of coconut, sweetened condensed milk, rum, water, vanilla, cinnamon, and cloves; blend until combined, about 30 seconds. </li>
                <li>Pour into sterilized glass bottles and store in the refrigerator; serve cold or over ice, if desired.</li>
             </ol>
